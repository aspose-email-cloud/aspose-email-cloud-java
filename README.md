## How to use the SDK?
The complete source code is available in the [GIT repository](https://github.com/aspose-email-cloud/aspose-email-cloud-java/tree/master/src/main/java/com/aspose/email/cloud/sdk).

Use [SDK tutorials](https://docs.aspose.cloud/email/sdk-tutorials/) and [SDK reference documentation](https://docs.aspose.cloud/email/reference-api/).

### Prerequisites
To use this SDK, you need a Client id and a Client secret; they can be looked up at [Aspose Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) (it requires free registration in Aspose Cloud for this).

### Installation
You can either directly use it in your project via jar file or add it as Maven dependency ([see repo](https://repository.aspose.cloud/repo/com/aspose/aspose-email-cloud/)):

First, you should add a repository:
```xml
<repository>
    <id>aspose-cloud</id>
    <name>Aspose.Cloud repository</name>
    <url>https://repository.aspose.cloud</url>
</repository>
```
Then, add a dependency:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-email-cloud</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

See more details about SDK installation in this tutorial: [SDK setup](https://docs.aspose.cloud/email/sdk-setup/).

### Usage examples
To use the API, you should create an EmailCloud object:
```java
EmailCloud api = new EmailCloud("Your Client secret", "Your Client id");
```
## Parse Business Card Image to VCard in Java

```java
	// Get your ClientId and ClientSecret from https://dashboard.aspose.cloud (free registration required).
	EmailCloud emailApi = new EmailCloud("MY_CLIENT_SECRET", "MY_CLIENT_ID");

	byte[] fileBytes = IOUtils.toByteArray(new FileInputStream("D:/alex.png"));
	ContactList result = emailApi.ai().bcr().parse(new AiBcrParseRequest(fileBytes, null, null, true));
	ContactDto contact = result.getValue().get(0);
```
